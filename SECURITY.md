## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Contact Information
- **Primary Contact:** Jordan Ehrig - jordan@ehrig.dev
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Secure Communication:** Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting

## Vulnerability Handling

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, container escape, data breach potential
- **High:** Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, secret exposure
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, denial of service, resource exhaustion
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact

### Response Timeline
- **Critical:** 24 hours
- **High:** 72 hours  
- **Medium:** 1 week
- **Low:** 2 weeks

## Security Measures

### Deployment Security
- Container isolation and resource limits
- Non-root user execution where possible
- Secure secret management via environment variables
- Network segmentation and access controls
- Regular security updates for base images

### Configuration Security
- No secrets in container images or repositories
- Environment-based configuration injection
- Access logging and monitoring
- Secure defaults for all configurations
- Regular credential rotation

### Infrastructure Security
- Firewall and network access controls
- VPN access for management interfaces
- Encrypted communication channels
- Backup encryption and secure storage
- Monitoring and alerting systems
